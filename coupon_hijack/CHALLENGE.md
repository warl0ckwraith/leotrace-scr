# Name - Coupon hijack

You're shopping at FlashDeals, an online store with amazing discounts. The **Golden Trophy** costs $1,000, but you only have $50.

A friend who works there told you about a secret admin coupon `ADMIN99` that gives 99% off. When you try to use it, the system blocks you saying "Admin coupon not allowed."

**Goal:** Buy the trophy for under $50

## Start the challenge

```bash
pip install flask
python app.py
```

The shop is at `http://localhost:5000`

## Available Coupons

- `SAVE10` - 10% off
- `SAVE25` - 25% off
- `SAVE50` - 50% off
- `ADMIN99` - 99% off (admin only)

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"item": "trophy", "coupon": "SAVE50"}'
```

This gives you 50% off ($500), but you need to get it under $50...
